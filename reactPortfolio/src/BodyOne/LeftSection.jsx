      <p>
        Hi! I'm Sabella Fisseha, originally from Eritrea but raised in BahirDar,
        Ethiopia (a beautiful place known for the Blue Nile and Lake Tana!).
        Since 2022, I've called Manchester, UK home. I finished Ethiopian high
        school and am now tackling a Software and Web Development course at
        <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/"> CYF</a>. My passion for coding was
        sparked by excelling in English and Math, and I love to keep honing my
        skills in my free time.When I'm not coding, I love catching movies and
        cheering on my favorite football team!
